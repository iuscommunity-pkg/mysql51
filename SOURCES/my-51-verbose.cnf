[mysqld]

### General
datadir                         = /var/lib/mysql
tmpdir                          = /var/lib/mysqltmp
socket                          = /var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock
skip-external-locking           = 1

## This prevents using host-based authentication. That means users must be
## created using an ip-address (ie 'myuser'@'192.168.100.1') or must make
## use of the % wildcard (ie 'myuser'@'%'). The benefit to not using
## host-based authentication is that DNS will not impact MySQL performance.
skip-name-resolve

## If open-files-limit is set very low, MySQL may increase on its own. Either
## way, increase this if MySQL gives 'too many open files' errors. Setting
## this above 65535 could be unwise (MySQL may crash).
open-files-limit                = 20000

## Set this to change the way MySQL handles validation, data conversion, etc.
## Be careful with this setting as it can cause unexpected results and 
## horribly break some applications! Note, too, that it can be set per-session
## and can be hard set in stored procedures.
#sql-mode                       = TRADITIONAL

#event-scheduler                = 1

### Cache
thread-cache-size               = 16
table-open-cache                = 2048
table-definition-cache          = 512

## Generally, it is unwise to set the query cache to be larger than 64-128M 
## as the costs associated with maintaining the cache outweigh the performance
## gains. A far superior solution would be to implement memcached, though this
## required modifying the application, among other things.
query-cache-size                = 32M 
query-cache-limit               = 1M

### Per-thread Buffers
sort-buffer-size                = 1M
read-buffer-size                = 1M
read-rnd-buffer-size            = 8M
join-buffer-size                = 1M

### Temp Tables
tmp-table-size                  = 64M 
max-heap-table-size             = 64M 

### Networking
back-log                        = 100
#max-connections                = 200
max-connect-errors              = 10000
max-allowed-packet              = 16M
interactive-timeout             = 600
wait-timeout                    = 600

#### Storage Engines
## Set this to force MySQL to use a particular engine / table-type
## for new tables. This setting can still be overridden by specifying
## the engine explicitly in the CREATE TABLE statement.
#default-storage-engine         = InnoDB

## Makes sure MySQL does not start if InnoDB fails to start. This helps
## prevent ugly silent failures.
innodb                          = FORCE

### MyISAM
## Not sure what to set this to?
## Try running a 'du -sch /var/lib/mysql/*/*.MYI'
## This will give you a good estimate on the size of all the MyISAM indexes.
## (The buffer may not need to set that high, however)
key-buffer-size                 = 64M 
## This setting controls the size of the buffer that is allocated when 
## sorting MyISAM indexes during a REPAIR TABLE or when creating indexes 
## with CREATE INDEX or ALTER TABLE.
myisam-sort-buffer-size         = 128M

### InnoDB
## Note: While most settings in MySQL can be set at run-time, many InnoDB
## variables cannot be set at runtime as require restarting MySQL
###
## These settings control how much RAM InnoDB will use. Generally, when using
## mostly InnoDB tables, the innodb-buffer-pool-size should be as large as
## is possible without swapping or starving other processes of RAM. The other 
## two settings usually do not need to be changed, but can help for very large 
## datasets.
innodb-buffer-pool-size         = 16M
innodb-log-buffer-size          = 4M
#innodb-additional-mem-pool-size= 20M

## This can help, but can also hinder performance. Test appropriately!
## (For SAN, O_DIRECT is almost never a good idea)
#innodb-flush-method            = O_DIRECT

## innodb-file-per-table can offer quite a few advantages, but does not work
## well when using it with a very large number of tables.
## If innodb-file-per-table is used, be sure to set innodb-open-files 
## appropriately (which is roughly similar to open-files-limit, but is
## exclusive to InnoDB)
#innodb-file-per-table          = 1
#innodb-open-files              = 300

## If you are not sure what to set this to, the following formula can offer 
## up a rough idea:
## (number of cpus * number of disks * 2)
#innodb-thread-concurrency      = 16

## This can increase performance for single servers as disabling this enabled
## group-commit. This is not a viable option when using binary logging or 
## replication, however.
#innodb-support-xa              = 0

## Be careful when changing these as they require re-generating the 
## ib-logfile* files, which must be done carefully. Do not change this unless 
## you are familiar with the procedure.
#innodb-log-file-size           = 100M
#innodb-log-group-home-dir      = /var/lib/mysql
innodb-log-files-in-group      = 2

## You cannot change this without dumping out the data and re-importing it!
#innodb-data-file-path          = ibdata1:2000M;ibdata2:10M:autoextend
#innodb-data-home-dir           = /var/lib/mysql

### Replication

## Tired of running into replication errors due to having the same server
## id on two servers? Consider changing this variable to the Rackspace
## server number.
server-id                       = 1

## This sets the format used when logging to the binary log
## - ROW will force row-based logging
## - STATEMENT will force statement-based (ie pre 5.1) logging
## - MIXED wil use both, depending on the situation
## Note that this setting has implications for both replication and
## backups, so do not change this unless you know what you are doing!
#binlog-format                  = STATEMENT

#log-bin                        = /var/lib/mysqllogs/bin-log
#relay-log                      = /var/lib/mysqllogs/relay-log
#expire-logs-days               = 14

## This should be enabled on conventional MySQL slaves
#read-only                      = 1

## Enable this to make replication more resilient against server 
## crashes and restarts, at the expense of higher I/O on the server.
#sync-binlog                    = 1

## This is usually only needed when setting up chained replication.
#log-slave-updates              = 1

## Uncomment the following when enabling multi-master replication
## Do NOT uncomment these unless you know exactly what you are doing!
#auto-increment-offset          = 1
#auto-increment-increment       = 2

### Logging
## This option determines the destination for general query log and slow query log output.
## The option value can be given as one or more of the words TABLE, FILE, or NONE.
## NOTE: Table logging takes away 50% of performance and thus is not recommended
##       http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=30414
## In addition, you cannot backup the contents of these tables properly
## (mysqldump skips these tables by default since they cannot be locked)
#log-output                     = FILE
#slow-query-log                 = 1
#slow-query-log-file            = /var/lib/mysqllogs/slow-log
#long-query-time                = 2
#log-queries-not-using-indexes  = 1
